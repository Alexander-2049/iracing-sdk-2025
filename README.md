# node-irsdk-2023

Unofficial [iRacing](http://www.iracing.com/) SDK implementation for NodeJS.

## DISCLAIMER
First of all I'm a self-taught coder and wouldn't call myself a developer as I have no educational background.

As I had various errors with the original repo [node-irsdk](https://github.com/apihlaja/node-irsdk) By Antti Pihlaja
and also several forks, I've tried to puzzle the barebones pieces together to get this version running, starting with
[node-irsdk-2021](https://github.com/mcalapurge/node-irsdk) By Nekaiko.

So, this version works as of 30/12/2022 with no prebuild and only the necessary dependencies, but at least no vulnerabilities.
Also there is none of the previous testing framework.
